JavaScript libraries' versions
==============

You might want to use custom versions of the libraries included by GraphiQL.
This can be achieved in the bundle configuration, example:

```yaml
overblog_graphiql:
    javascript_libraries:
        graphiql: "0.11"
        react: "15.6"
        fetch: "2.0"
```
